## Spring Basic

Before joined in company, I do not have any experience in developing web application with Spring Framework. I heard people saying IOC or AOP so many times, but for me, I didn't get how these features helping engineer to develop.

After working for roughly more than half a year in web development, I want to do some basic summary of how I understand Spring and its features.

### IOC

Inversion of Control.

### AOP

Aspect of programming.
